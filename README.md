NB-IoT Smart Parking System
===========================

An Introduction to NB-IoT
-------------------------

### Definitions

1. **Narrowband IoT** (aka NB-IoT or LTE-M2) is a cellular technology that specializes in communication between objects which require small amounts of data, over long periods, in hard to reach places. More specifically, NB-IoT is a LPWAN technology which works virtually everywhere.

2. **LPWAN** stands for low-power wide area network. This is a wireless wide area network technology that interconnects low-bandwidth, battery-powered devices with low bit rates over long ranges.

### More about NB-IoT
NB-IoT operates outside of the licensed LTE construct. Instead, it works either 1) independently, 2) in unused 200-kHz bands that have previously been used for GSM - Global System for Mobile Communications, or 3) on LE base stations which offer a resource block to NB-IoT operations or in their guard bands.

### Benefits of NB-IoT
1. Power Efficiency
2. Cost Savings
3. Reliability
4. Wider Deployment
5. Global Reach

NB-IoT applications and solutions stretch across the board. From asset tracking to smart cities to fleet and smart buildings, this technology unlocks game-changing results. To demonstrate the practice of this concept, we can build our own full-stack prototype of a NB-IoT smart parking system utilizing T-Mobile's Narrowband Network and the Twilio NB-IoT DevKit and Breakout SDK.
